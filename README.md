# Experiments with RDA PIDINST and PIDINST-SCHEMA

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This repository contains some simple experiments with the RDA PIDINST
schema and the creation of a simple ontology based on it. The schema is
available at
[rdawg-pidinst](https://github.com/rdawg-pidinst/schema/blob/master/schema.rst).
The ontology is available at [pidinst.ttl](./data/pidinst.ttl) as well
as SHACL shapes at [pidinst-shapes.ttl](./data/pidinst-shapes.ttl). It
contains a sample pidinst JSON schema extracted from the [ODIS
Architecture GitHub
Issue](https://github.com/iodepo/odis-arch/issues/68#issuecomment-1353075204)
in the file [pidinst-schema.json](./data/pidinst-schema.json) and
[pidinst-example.json](./data/pidinst-example.json) which is a sample
instance of the schema. A data prototype is in the Sarowar Hossain
[Github repository](https://github.com/shmishkat/DataPrototype).
Analysis was done with ChatGPT GPT-4 with bing web plugin for Retrieval
Augmented Generation.

## Sample Use Case

The owner of the instrument is the NSF facility MagLab
(https://ror.org/03s53g630). Josiah Carberry’s
(https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097) data acquisition info:

The experimental data (spectra) are acquired by a spectrometer (#1
HRS750, \#2 IsoPlane, Teledyne Princeton Instruments). The spectrometers
are (almost) fully automated and controlled via the LightField software
(Teledyne Princeton Instruments). LightField automatically saves the
acquired data and all experiment settings (spectrometer settings) in one
file.
https://www.princetoninstruments.com/products/software-family/lightfield

LightField saves files in \*.SPE format (whatever it means).

## Thematic references in sample data

ChatGPT was used to do the thematic analysis of the sample data.
[PIDINST
JSON](https://chat.openai.com/share/2e4ef2c4-23e8-4f14-aca5-96bb2d0346af)
is the link to the chat.

The sample data provided has the following semantic themes that
potentially map to persistent identifiers:

- Observation
  ([sosa:Observation](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#SOSAObservation),
  [schema:Observation](https://schema.org/Observation))
- Experiment (Activity)
- Instrument (PIDINST, sosa, [handle.net registry](https://handle.net/))
- Sample (RRID)
- Agent (Person, Organization, Software)
  - Person (ORCID)
  - Organization (ROR)
  - Software ([SBoM](https://spdx.dev/),
    [Codemeta](https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta) )
- Location ([w3c locn](https://www.w3.org/ns/locn),
  [schema.org](https://schema.org/location))
- Dataset (DOI)
- Physical Parameters: There are various physical parameters involved in
  the experiments, such as type of experiment (PL, Ra, Re, Tr), sample
  name, magnetic field, temperature, light source, power, central
  frequency/wavelength/energy, slit value, acquisition time, objective
  numerical aperture (NA), and others like gate voltage, pressure.
  Ontology patterns representing these physical parameters, their units
  of measurement (T, K, nm, mW/uW/%, cm-1/nm/eV, um, min/sec, NA, V),
  and their roles in the experiment would be necessary.
- Experimental Procedure: The narrative also implies a certain procedure
  or workflow that is followed in conducting the experiments and saving
  the data. This could be represented by an ontology pattern describing
  scientific procedures or workflows.

Thematically, we have something that is defined as an
[Affordance](https://w3c.github.io/wot-architecture/#sec-affordances) in
terms of variables that we can measure (this is confusing LLM agents and
potential instrument settings. We need a specification of these
“affordances” in the PIDINST doc. This is separate from the the settings
that were used in the “Observation” which is an instantiation of a
particular set of affordances in a “Activity” that is an experiment.

## Alignments to Science on schema.org

Based on the information collected, here’s an analysis of the selected
ontologies:

1.  **Schema.org**: Schema.org is a widely used vocabulary that aims to
    standardize HTML tags to create rich results about a certain topic
    of interest. It helps make document mark-up codes more readable and
    meaningful for both humans and
    machines【61†source】【62†source】【63†source】【65†source】.
    Despite its advantages, as of 2016, its adoption was limited, with a
    survey showing only 17% uptake among US-based marketing agencies and
    B2C advertisers【64†source】.

2.  **ESIP Science on Schema.org (SOSO)**: SOSO provides guidelines for
    repository operators and others to follow consistent conventions to
    provide schema.org markup in Dataset landing pages to improve data
    discovery through search engines. The main guides help describe
    Datasets and Data Repositories. This guidance was created by members
    of the ESIP science-on-schema.org cluster, and it’s a continuation
    of the P418 NSF EarthCube vocabulary
    guidance【40†source】【41†source】【42†source】.

3.  **W3C SOSA**: The Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology, which
    includes SOSA, is an ontology for describing sensors and their
    observations, the involved procedures, the studied features of
    interest, the samples used to do so, and the observed properties, as
    well as actuators. SOSA provides a lightweight but self-contained
    core ontology for its elementary classes and properties and can
    support a wide range of applications and use cases【48†source】.

4.  **W3C Prov-O**: The PROV Ontology (PROV-O) provides a set of
    classes, properties, and restrictions that can be used to represent
    and interchange provenance information generated in different
    systems and under different contexts. It can be specialized to
    create new classes and properties to model provenance information
    for different applications and domains. PROV-O is a lightweight
    ontology that can be adopted in a wide range of
    applications【54†source】【55†source】.

The thematic analysis identified a set of thematic classes like Agent,
Dataset, Location, etc. All these ontologies provide extensive coverage
for these themes.

- **Agent**: Prov-O has a class `prov:Agent` that can represent both
  Person and Organization. schema.org also provides classes for `Person`
  and `Organization`.
- **Dataset**: Both schema.org and SOSO provide classes for `Dataset`.
- **Location**: schema.org provides classes for representing different
  types of locations.
- **Sample**: The SOSA ontology from W3C provides a class `sosa:Sample`
  to represent samples used in observations.
- **Instrument**: While there isn’t a direct match, classes from
  schema.org or the `prov:Entity` class from Prov-O could potentially be
  used to represent an Instrument.
- **Observation and Experiment**: The SOSA ontology provides classes for
  representing observations (`sosa:Observation`). The representation of
  an experiment might involve using a combination of classes from these
  ontologies, like `prov:Activity` from Prov-O, and potentially some
  domain-specific classes.

Overall, it seems like a combination of these ontologies could be used
to represent the themes identified in the analysis, although some
customization and extension might be required for specific use cases or
domain-specific needs.

Based on the analysis of the different ontologies and their relationship
to the thematic classes, here are some insights:

1.  **Schema.org**: It provides a robust and flexible vocabulary for
    representing datasets and their associated entities. However, it
    might require some customization or extension for representing more
    domain-specific concepts like “Observation” and “Instrument”. The
    ESIP’s Science on Schema.org (SOSO) recommendations provide valuable
    guidance on how to use schema.org for scientific datasets, and could
    potentially be extended to cover these additional concepts. The
    “Instrument” class, for example, could be represented using the
    general “Product” type that schema.org provides, with properties
    such as brand, model, and manufacturer. An alternative could be to
    use the “Thing” type, which is the most generic type in schema.org,
    and add custom properties as needed. The “Experiment” class could be
    represented using the “ResearchProject” type in schema.org, which is
    a subtype of “Project”. This type allows for properties like
    “leader” (the PI), “participant” (other people involved in the
    experiment), “startTime” and “endTime” (for the duration of the
    experiment), and “result” (for the outcome of the experiment, which
    could be a dataset)【65†source】【61†source】.

2.  **W3C PROV-O**: The PROV Ontology (PROV-O) provides a set of
    classes, properties, and restrictions that can be used to represent
    and interchange provenance information generated in different
    systems and under different contexts. It can also be specialized to
    create new classes and properties to model provenance information
    for different applications and domains. This ontology aligns well
    with the thematic classes that involve the capture of provenance
    information, such as “Observation”, “Dataset”, and “Agent” (Person,
    Organization, etc.). Moreover, the notion of “Activity” in PROV-O
    can be used to represent the “Experiment” class, and the
    “wasGeneratedBy” property can be used to link a “Dataset” to its
    generating “Experiment”【55†source】.

3.  **W3C SOSA**: The Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator (SOSA)
    ontology is designed for describing sensors and their observations,
    the involved procedures, the studied features of interest, the
    samples used to do so, and the observed properties, as well as
    actuators. SOSA can be used to represent the “Observation” and
    “Instrument” (as “Sensor”) classes in the thematic analysis. It also
    includes a “Platform” class, which could potentially be used to
    represent an experimental setup where multiple instruments are used.
    The “madeObservation” property can link a “Sensor” to its produced
    “Observation”, and the “usedProcedure” property can capture the
    experimental procedure involved in the observation【48†source】.

In terms of interoperability, schema.org, PROV-O, and SOSA all follow
the principles of Linked Data and use the RDF data model, which enables
them to be combined and used together in a consistent way. The use of
shared identifiers for common concepts (e.g., foaf:Person,
dcterms:Dataset) can further enhance the interoperability between these
ontologies. Additionally, schema.org provides an extension mechanism for
adding additional properties, which can be used to incorporate elements
from PROV-O or SOSA as needed.

Please note that the alignment of these ontologies with the thematic
classes is a high-level assessment and the actual implementation may
require more detailed analysis and customization to suit the specific
needs and contexts of the use cases.

## ChatGPT summary

Certainly, the following provides a range of options that the MagLab
could consider when developing their semantic infrastructure, taking
into consideration both minimal and more comprehensive approaches.

1.  **Minimal Approach - Schema.org metadata for experiments:**
    - *Description:* Use Schema.org terms to describe the key features
      of your experiments. This involves adding appropriate Schema.org
      types (like `Dataset`, `Person`, `Organization`, etc.) and
      properties to your HTML metadata.
    - *FAIR perspective:* This approach would increase the Findability
      and Interoperability of your datasets, as Schema.org is widely
      recognized and used by major search engines, aiding in data
      discovery. However, this is a general-purpose vocabulary and may
      lack the specificity required to fully describe scientific
      experiments.
2.  **Mid-level Approach - Schema.org + ESIP Science-on-Schema.org
    guidelines:**
    - *Description:* Extend the minimal approach by following ESIP’s
      guidelines for using Schema.org in a scientific context. This
      provides a richer description of your data and includes terms from
      QUDT to quantify units and measuredVariables.
    - *FAIR perspective:* By adhering to a community-accepted standard
      like ESIP, you enhance the Interoperability and Reusability of
      your data, as others in the scientific community will have a
      better understanding of the metadata and can use it more
      effectively.
3.  **Advanced Approach - Adopt a more descriptive Ontology Design
    Pattern (ODP):**
    - *Description:* Implement a more formal ontology structure by
      creating a pattern that separates `Experiment`, `Instrument`, and
      `Sample` as distinct entities that participate in the `Experiment`
      process. This can be achieved with Semanticscience Integrated
      Ontology (SIO), which provides a rich semantic framework for
      describing scientific entities and processes. Here, `Instrument`
      and `Sample` participate in `Experiment`, which is a subclass of
      `SIO:Process` (or `prov:Activity` for alignment with PROV-O).
    - *FAIR perspective:* This approach would greatly enhance the
      Interoperability and Reusability of your data by providing a
      robust and expressive semantic model for your experiments. This
      detailed semantic information can improve data discovery and
      understanding, aiding both human users and automated processes.
4.  **Comprehensive Approach - Integrate with existing ontologies and
    identifiers:**
    - *Description:* Further expand the advanced approach by aligning
      with existing ontologies and identifier systems. This could
      include leveraging the PhysicalSamples ontology and Instrument
      identifiers (PIDINST) from RDA, BioSchemas recommendations, and
      RRIDs for tracking samples. Use OWL-Time and W3C locn for
      representing time and location, respectively.
    - *FAIR perspective:* This approach ensures maximal Findability,
      Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability of your data by
      adhering to well-established standards and practices. It promotes
      data integration, comparison, and reuse across different studies
      and scientific fields.

In summary, the chosen approach depends on the specific needs and
resources of the MagLab. A more comprehensive approach offers greater
FAIR compliance and utility for data users but requires more effort to
implement and maintain. Consider the FAIR principles as guiding
concepts, promoting maximum use and reuse of your valuable data.
Remember that being FAIR is a journey, not a destination, and even small
steps towards better metadata can have a significant impact on data
utility.
